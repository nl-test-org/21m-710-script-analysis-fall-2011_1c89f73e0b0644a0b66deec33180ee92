Course Description
------------------

This course focuses on developing skills in the reading of scripts for the theater. We will examine how scene construction, use of theatrical strategies such as setting, lighting, and dialogue express story and theme, what choices the script makes available to the actor and director, and how language contributes to the construction of a dramatic world.

Course Requirements
-------------------

Since there will be a lot of class discussion of each script, any absences over two (excused or unexcused) will lower the class member's grade.

Reading assignments must be completed before the first day of discussion. Don't try to fake it.

All papers must be submitted, electronically or hard copy, when they are due. Rewrites or revisions may be required. Please make enough paper copies to distribute to the rest of the class for their comments, or be sure to send your electronic copy to the class mailing list.
